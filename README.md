- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kolzsticks
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, graphic design, and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced PHP techniques and exploring frameworks like Laravel. I'm also working with MySQL for database management.
- 💻 Additionally, I'm diving into modern front-end development using **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** for efficient and responsive designs.
- 🔍 I'm also exploring search functionalities using **Typesense** for fast, scalable, and flexible search implementation.
- ⚡ I've been optimizing my projects for **SEO** with **server-side rendering (SSR)** and improving performance using techniques like **dynamic imports** and **lazy loading**.
- 🛠 For build and bundling, I prefer **Vite** for its speed and efficiency in modern web development.
- 🎨 On the creative side, I use **Flowbite** and **Swiper** to enhance UI and UX design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PHP projects, JavaScript development, React/Next.js, and creative design.
