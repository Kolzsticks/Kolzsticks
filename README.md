- 👋 Hello, I’m @Kolzsticks
- 👀 My interests lie in web and software development.
- 💻 Currently, I'm delving into **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, harnessing the power of modern **JavaScript** to create scalable and efficient applications.

- ⚡ I focus on optimizing my projects for **SEO** through **server-side rendering (SSR)** and enhancing performance with techniques such as **dynamic imports** and **lazy loading**.
- 💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects involving JavaScript development, React/Next.js, and creative design.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at akoladebodeajayi@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In addition to coding, I enjoy playing the piano.
